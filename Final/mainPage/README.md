## Project Overview
+ The theme of my project is an online clothing store where customers can interact with the project using a graphical user interface. The customer can choose the type of product they are interested in and choose clothes. The site provides maximum convenience for the user, where the user can choose the distance, the delivery transport and the amount in 4 currencies will be displayed, so the user can use the delivery function.

+ The idea of the project:
  + Creating a basic store using the main web development languages to display products and shopping cart.
  + Creating a simple database for storing information about the store's products and displaying this information on a web page.
  + The use of CSS frameworks (for example, Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS) to improve the appearance of the store and create an adaptive design.
  + Development of the possibility of adding products to the shopping cart.
---
+ The goal of the project:
  + Improving the skills of working with design patterns: Mastering the interaction of patterns to improve the purity of the code and functionality of the store interface.
  + Understanding working with a database: Learning the basics of working with a database to store information about products and store users.
  + Development of the main functionality of the store: Creation of a system for displaying goods and forming a shopping cart.
  + Mastering adaptive design: Exploring approaches to creating mobile-adaptive design for the convenience of using the store on various devices.
  + Optimizing Performance and Loading Speed: Understanding site optimization techniques to speed up its loading and improve the user experience.
  + Improving the User Interface: Learning the principles of improving the user interface using CSS and JavaScript for a more intuitive and engaging experience.
  + Learning the basics of documentation: Mastering the basic principles of documenting code and project to create readable and understandable documentation.
  + Learning the basics of documentation: Mastering the basic principles of documenting code and project to create readable and understandable documentation.

## Main Body:
+ Include explanations of each feature and design pattern:
  + *In this project, "Factory Method" is responsible for creating various types of goods:*

       ### In the product menu, the customer can choose the type of product that is most interested in.
    +  ![](photo/productImg.jpg)
       ### After this process, a certain number of products will appear, and customers can view the product.
  + *Decorator Design Pattern responds to adding additional options to products:*

     ![](photo/shirtImg.jpg)
      ### By clicking on the "Info" button, customers can view additional information and options about the product.
  + *The observer design pattern tracks changes in the condition of the goods:*
    + ![](photo/notificationImg.jpg)
  + *In this project, Singleton Design Pattern is used to manage the user's shopping cart:*
    + ![](photo/singletonImg.jpg)
       ### By clicking on the "Add" button, the customer can add the product to the user's cart.
  + *In this project, the "Strategy Design Pattern" is used to calculate the cost of delivery:*
    + ![](photo/deliveryImg.jpg)
      ### The user must specify the distance and select the type of transport, after which the amount that the user must pay in order to use the delivery function will be automatically displayed.
  + *In this project, "Adapter" is used for integration with various payment systems:*
